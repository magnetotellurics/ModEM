Making a new test program "test_Amult" -- cut down from test_FWD

ModelReader_Weerachai.f90  -- removed default setting of airlayers
before inital creation of grid .   Now after reading grid HAVE TO
SET AIR LAYERS:   as an example see test_Amult:
! Read Grid and ModelParameter with ModelReader_Weerachai
 97       call model_reader%Read( model_file_name, main_grid, model_parameter )
 98       !
 99       select type( main_grid )
100          !
101          class is( Grid3D_SG_t )
102             !   ADD Air Layers to grid -- this has to be done in general now!!!
103             !    I am just setting this explicitly for the A from file case --
104             !    More generally, could have a default ---  but I think we should
105             !    set this explicitly outside of the gridReader procedure(s)
106 
107             call main_grid%SetupAirLayers(air_layer, method, nzAir,maxHeight)
108             !   as coded have to use air_layer data structure to update grid
109             call main_grid%UpdateAirLayers(air_layer%nz, air_layer%dz)

NOT TESTED (but it finally compiles!)

Made new test program test_Amult   -- but cannot get it to compile.
I try to create cVector3D_SG_t objects x and y, but get very strange error messages,
that I cannot understand.
