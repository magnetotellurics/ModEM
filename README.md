Global3D / Earth ModEM
======================

This version of ModEM is a global version that uses a forward solver that was
created by Uyeshima & Schultz (2000). You can compile it in a similar way to
normal ModEM:

```
$ ./CONFIG/Configure.EARTH.OSU.GFortran Makefile Release
```

The configuration files have some difficulty creating MPI Makefiles, except for
`./CONFIG/Configure.EARTH.OSU.Intel`. You can use the `Makefile.gnu.mpi` to
compmile with MPI:

```
$ make -f Makefile.gnu.mpi
```

An example of a Global run can be found in [ModEM-Examples][ModEM-Examples]
