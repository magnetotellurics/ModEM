# ModEM-ON

ModEM-ON is a software package for the joint inversion of 3D electromagnetic
data with emphasis on geophysical applications. It is based on the ModEM code
(http://www.modem-geophysics.com/) from Dr. Gary Egbert.

# Summary

We propose to implement workflows for the integration of multiphysics data using
a 3D code for the joint inversion of CSEM, and seismic data. Such workflows will
be built based on extensions to the software ModEM. 

# Methodology

## Forward modeling

## Parameterization and regularization

## Flexible joint inversion

## User interface
