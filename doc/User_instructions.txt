This note explains how to set up SVN to always have the latest stable 
version of ModEM.   These instructions assume a subversion (svn) client
is already installed.   Your account was created with the username you
requested, with the password initially set to your full name, as indicated
in the text of the email that this message is attached to.   You can change
your password (if desired) by logging in with your given username and password at 
	http://ohm.coas.oregonstate.edu:3343/
Under "Other Actions" choose "view and edit your profile", then click "Edit"
on the page that appears, then "Change Password" on the next page.  Hit update
after making any changes.   

You can navigate from this page to see all repositories you have access to
(In general only the stable branch of ModEM.)  If you do this, you will
be prompted for username and password.     You can also get directly to
the code and its change log using the URL:
	http://ohm.coas.oregonstate.edu/viewvc/ModEM/branches/stable

The viewvc interface reached through this URL can be used to checkout 
the code for the first time, or to update, if there are updates.
However, you can do this more easily from a command line by typing
	svn checkout http://ohm.coas.oregonstate.edu/svn/ModEM/branches/stable ModEM --username <user_name>
You will be prompted for a password, and the code will be copied into (new)
subdirectory ModEM.

The ModEM directory should now contain the README and COPYRIGHT files,
as well as the source code, documentation and some example files.
Please review the README and COPYRIGHT, and comply with all use restrictions.
Instructions on compiling the code are also found in the README file.
Some further information on the code, including runtime options, capabilities 
and file formats are described (albeit too briefly) in the User Guide.   To
access this document:
   cd ModEM/doc/userguide
   acroread ModularEM_UserGuide.pdf

To fetch the latest version of the code at a later stage:
   cd ModEM
   svn update

When you use ModEM, please refer to

for Electromagnetic Inverse Problems", Geophys. J. Int., v. 189,

A modular system for inversion of electromagnetic geophysical data",

The two papers are available from the ModEM/doc/ subdirectory. 
Developers might also be interested in the detailed User Manual, 
found in the ModEM/doc/misc/ subdirectory.  The above should be 
sufficient for most users. 

A few additional notes for use on Windows:

1) Download and install TortoiseSVN (or some other version, if you
prefer):
   http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads

   The installer is self-explanatory and will require you
   to close almost all programs and restart the computer.

2) Create a directory where you'd like the code to reside.
   Right-click on that directory and choose 'SVN Checkout'

3) Type the URL of repository:
   http://mt.coas.oregonstate.edu/svn/ModEM/branches/stable
   and click 'OK'

4) Your local directory should now contain the README and COPYRIGHT files,
   as well as the source code, documentation and some example files.
   Please review the README and COPYRIGHT to compile.

5) To fetch the latest version of the code at any time,
   right click on the directory and choose 'SVN update'.
   If you've made temporary changes, do 'TortoiseSVN -> Revert'
   before running 'SVN update'.
