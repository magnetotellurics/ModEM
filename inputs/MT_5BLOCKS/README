Files:

    m.ws     - synthetic model used to generate data ("True Model")
    d0.dat   - data template (sampling pattern in frequency and space)
    d_05.dat - synthetic data with 5% noise added
    m0.ws    - grid (same as for m,ws) with half space
	           use for starting model for inversion tests.
			   
NOTE:  since there is no topography a covariance file is not needed!
